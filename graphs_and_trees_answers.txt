What is a binary tree and what makes it unique to other trees?

A binary tree has two child nodes beneath the root, each node beneath those can also have
two nodes. It always has one node that branches into two (binary) nodes. Other trees may 
differ in the number of nodes they have or how they oganize data. 

What is a heuristic?

A heuristic is basically a guess that an algorithm makes to solve a problem faster, but does so 
with less accuracy. 

What is another problem besides the shortest-path problem that requires the use of heuristics?

Finding a number in a list of numbers. Say numbers 0-100 are listed out, you could guess that
the number of interest is greater than 50 but less than 100 and search only 50 numbers, 
and progressively narrow the search by 50%. However this may not be accurate it is fast. 

What is the difference between a depth-first search and a breadth-first search?

The differnece is how the search passes through data. Depth of field searching is like looking down 
a column of data, if the data of interest is not there, move to the next column. Though not litteraly 
a colum, it searches the right or left most path and progressively works across the graph vertically. 
A breadth serach is like searching along rows, it looks at the first order of nodes, then the next order
and so on searching across the entire tree. 

Explain in your own words what an undirected, a-cyclic, unweighted graph is.

This could be a doubly linked list which traversing nodes could go in one or two directions, but have 
terminal ends that do not link back to the start. Each node passed has no infomation about the complexity 
of navigating further or returning. Or like a two way street(undirected) from point to point(a-cyclic) 
with speed limit and traffic lights (weight). 

What kind of graph is a binary search tree?

Directed, a-cyclic, unweighted.
